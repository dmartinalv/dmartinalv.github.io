I'm Diego, a second-year master's student in the MA in Social Sciences at the Carlos III - Juan March Institute in Madrid, and a political scientist in the making. Since December 2024, I also work as an RA to Pau Vall-Prat.

My main research interests lie in the field of historical political economy, and they include the politics of early educational reforms and cultural policies, secularization and its link to state building, and, in general, historical political (mainly electoral) behavior. My master thesis focuses on the politics of non-formal educational policies during the 1930s, analyzing the political consequences of the Spanish Pedagogical Missions.

Moreover, I am interested in political geography, with a particular focus on geographies of discontent and patterns of geographical political divisions, both in historical perspective and in the present.
