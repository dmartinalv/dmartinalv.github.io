    "text": "I’m Diego, a second-year master’s student in the MA in Social Sciences at the Carlos III - Juan March Institute in Madrid, and a political scientist in the making. Since December 2024, I also work as an RA to Pau Vall-Prat.\nMy main research interests lie in the field of historical political economy, and they include the politics of early educational reforms, state building and nation building at the turn of the 20th century, and the political consequences of land reforms. I wrote my master thesis on the politics of early non-formal education in Spain during the 1930s.\nMoreover, I am interested in political geography, with a particular focus on geographies of discontent and patterns of geographical political polarization; and in political psychology, especially regarding in-group and out-group dynamics."
