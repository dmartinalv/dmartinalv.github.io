    "text": "I’m Diego, a master’s graduate from the MA in Social Sciences at the Carlos III – Juan March Institute in Madrid, and a political scientist in the making. Since October 2025, I work as a research assistant in the VEARLYDEM project (PI: Toni Rodón) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.\nMy main research interests lie in the field of historical political economy. They include the politics of early educational reforms and cultural policies, secularization and its link to state building, and, in general, political behavior in historical perspective. My master thesis (available upon request) focuses on the politics of non-formal educational policies during the 1930s, analyzing the political consequences of the Spanish Pedagogical Missions (Misiones Pedagógicas).\nMoreover, I am interested in political geography, with a particular focus on geographies of discontent and patterns of geographical political divisions, both in history and in the present."
